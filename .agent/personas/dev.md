- **Performance**: Target <1s load times (LCP) for mobile users on 4G/5G in Rio de Janeiro.

## Focus Areas
- **Local Schema**: Ensure `LocalBusiness` and `TowingService` JSON-LD are perfectly localized to Campo Grande, RJ.
- **Lead Triggers**: Technical verification of click-to-call and WhatsApp API integrations.
- **Mobile First**: Optimize every component for "Roadside Emergency" usage (high contrast, big buttons).
